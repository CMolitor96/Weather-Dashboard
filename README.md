# Weather-Dashboard

Welcome to my weather dashboard. Type in a city, click search, and weather data will automatically populate the boxes on the screen, showing the current weather, and the 5 day forecast. Statistics include temperature, wind speed, humidity, and uv index. There is an icon for each day's forecast depicting the weather. The uv index is outlined in a colored box, ranging from green to purple, signifying the higher reading.
